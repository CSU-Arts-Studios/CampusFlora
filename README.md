### Abstract ###
CampusFlora is an application ecosystem and database that allows you to view and locate flora on Sydney Uni campus. It was built initially as an iOS app by a small team lead by Rosanne Quinnel at the University of Sydney, Australia in 2014.  
The web version of this project was built by Nic Barker (bitbucket username nicbarker) in early 2015, with the aim of separating the database from the front end implementation.
Sydney Uni's implementation of the site is always hosted live at [campusflora.sydneybiology.org](http://campusflora.sydneybiology.org).

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get your application up and running.
