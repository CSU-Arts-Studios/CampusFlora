The leaves are bright green in colour and slightly paler underneath. They become bright yellows, oranges, purples and reds in the autumn. The waxy green leaves set off the clusters of greenish-yellow and white flowers at bloom time. The flowers occur in terminal spike-like inflorescences up to 20 cm long. Light green in colour, these flowers are very conspicuous in the spring. Each pistillate (female) flower is solitary and has a three-lobed ovary, three styles, and no petals. They are located on short branches at the base of the spike. The staminate (male) flowers occur in clusters at the upper nodes of the inflorescence. Fruits are three-lobed, three-valved capsules. As the capsules mature, their colour changes from green to a brown-black. The capsule walls fall away and release three globose seeds with a white, tallow-containing covering.

      "information": "This fern is an Australian native and is notable due to its height. Ferns are seedless vascular plants and appeared in the Devonian about 400 million years ago. Vascular plants are those with xylem and phloem. Xylem are elongate cells with lignified walls that are specialised for water transport and lend structural support to the plant. Being able to transport water from the soil to the rest of the plant via this structural xylem system made life on land possible. Ferns do not have pollen: the male gametes (sperm) are motile and so the distribution of ferns is restricted to a moist habitat. Instead of seeds (which appeared later, ~ 350 million years ago) ferns have spores contained in sporangia. Sporangia develop in structures called sori. | ArborPlanID: C0362 |",

After shedding the seeds, the cone persists on the tree for several years because, as with many species of Cupressus, C. sempervirens displays varying levels of serotiny: cones may remain unopened on the tree for many years until a fire induces them to open and subsequently to shed viable seed.

Ferns do not have pollen; the male gametes (sperm) are motile and so the distribution of ferns is restricted to a moist habitat. Ferns are seedless vascular plants, which first appeared in the Devonian about 400 million years ago. Instead seeds (which appeared much later, ~ 350 million years ago) ferns have spores contained in sporangia; sporangia develop in structures called sori. The fossil records for this genus date back to 55 million years ago. Due to the prolific nature of the genus Pteridium the distribution of Dennstaedtiaceae is global, though generally this family is pantropical. Pteridium has the widest distribution of any fern worldwide. | ArborPlanID: C n/a |",

      "description": "It is a large tree in the banyan group of figs, growing to 30–40 m (rarely up to 60 m) tall, with a stout trunk up to 2 m in diameter. The trunk develops aerial and buttressing roots to anchor it in the soil and help support heavy branches. It has broad shiny oval leaves 10–35 cm long and 5–15 cm broad; leaf size is largest on young plants (occasionally to 45 cm), much smaller on old trees (typically 10 cm). The leaves develop inside a sheath at the apical meristem, which grows larger as the new leaf develops. When it is mature, it unfurls and the sheath drops off the plant. Inside the new leaf, another immature leaf is waiting to develop. (From Wikipedia: http://goo.gl/0n9q4R)"

Ferns do not have pollen: the male gametes (sperm) are motile and so the distribution of ferns is restricted to a moist habitat. Instead of seeds (which appeared later, ~ 350 million years ago) ferns have spores contained in sporangia. Sporangia develop in structures called sori. In this family the sori run linearly along the veins with a similarly-shaped indusium (protective flap). There are two genera in the Aspleniaceae: Asplenium and Pleurosorus. The rhizomes of Asplenium are usually short-creeping, covered clathrate (lattice-like) scales; they are mostly terrestrial and some are epiphytic. | ArborPlanID: Cn/a |",

It has fibrous, brown bark; long, narrow, dull green leaves, with tightly clustered inflorescences of small, white flowers in the axes. It grows in a weeping habit. Leaves up to 15 cm long and narrow. It is most readily identified by the powerful odour of peppermint emitted when the leaves are crushed or torn. The fruit is a hard capsule, 3 – 4 mm across, with three valves containing many small seeds. (From PlantNET: http://goo.gl/yqUEv5)"

The essential oil of the lemon-scented gum is used in both perfume and insect repellent. | ArborPlan+I498ID: C0063, C0554, C0684, C0685, C0689, C0814, C0815, C0817, C0818, C0819, C0864, C0976, C1156, C1198, D0063, D0093, D0094, D0095, D0096, D0098, D0099, D0147, D0310, D0311, D0312, D0313, D0314, D0315, D0316, D0317, D0318, D0319, D0320, D0321, D0322, D0323, D0324, D0325, D0326, D0327, D0328, D0329, D0330, D0331, D0332, D0333, D0334, D0335, D0336, D0337, D0338, D0339, D0340, D0341, D0342, D0343, D0344, D0345, D0346, D0347, D0348, D0349, D0350, D0351, D0352, D0353, D0354, D0355, D0356, D0357, D0358, D0359, D0360, D0361, D0362, D0368, D0369, D0370, D0371, D0372, D0373, D0374, D0375, D0376, D0377, D0378, D0379, D0380, D0381, D0382, D0383, D0384, D0385, D0386, D0387, D0390, D0391, D0392, D0393, D0394, D0395, D0396, D0397, D0398, D0399, D0400, D0401, D0402, D0403, D0404, D0405, D0471, D0743, D0890, D0891 |",

Instead these plants develop leaf-like structures called megasporophylls each with seeds on the lower margins. Cycads appeared about 250 million years ago and are some of the earliest extant seed plants, flourishing in the Jurassic.

The ovary is superior and has two carpels, whose wings elongate the flowers, making it easy to tell which flowers are female. Maples flower in late winter or early spring, in most species with or just after the appearance of the leaves, but in some before the trees leaf out. Maple flowers are green, yellow, orange or red. Though individually small, the effect of an entire tree in flower can be striking in several species. Some maples are an early spring source of pollen and nectar for bees.

Cycads are dioecious with pollen cones or strobili develop on male plants. Cycads appeared about 250 million years ago and are some of the earliest extant seed plants and they flourished in the Jurassic. Dinosaur fossils date from 200 to 300 million years ago, i.e. the Jurassic, which means that Cycads are the botanical equivalent of living dinosaurs. | ArborPlanID: C n/a |",

Roots can be aggressive and branches are usually covered with corky projections. The individual flowers of L. formosana are monoecious. However, both sexes can be found in the same plant. Male flowers are in catkins, female flowers form dense spherical heads, and the fruit is burr-like because of the persistent styles. (From Wikipedia: http://goo.gl/pD47rV)"
